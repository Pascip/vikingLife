Living like a Viking done right!

## Translator
You can translate any Language to the a fake but fun Viking language. 
If we come up with a new grammatical rule we will add it to this translator.

## Viking Ipsum
This is a simple Lorem Ipsum for real Vikings! 
Bored of the usual Lorem Ipsum? Well here you go! It's the Viking Ipsum, written in the fake Viking language. 
Big thanks to [Bacon Ipsum](https://baconipsum.com/) for the neat API, which I'm currently using as a word generator. 

## But why would you do that?
I honestly don't know. A friend and I came up with the Viking Language and I had to get into Vue.js...
